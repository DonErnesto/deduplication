# Material for the 2022 SFI Masterclass on unsupervised machine learning

Material is presented in Jupyter notebooks, that are located in the notebooks/ directory. 
The notebook CreditCardUnsupervised.ipynb requires little modifications to be ran successfully (these are the exercises).

The outlierutils.py module with helper functions is located in the root directory in the repo, and is downloaded within the notebook to the /notebooks directory, along with the data. 

The git-repo uses pre-commit hooks (amongst others flake8, jupyter-notebook-cleanup, black and isort) to verify code and notebook quality before committing.
